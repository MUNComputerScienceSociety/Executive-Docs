- Actually start the event, run for 2 weeks max
- Let people post screenshots of the builds in the discord in a dedicated channel, and allow people to vote on what their fav. ones are
- Pick winners based on said votes, discuss prize with them due to shipping being a pain

### Themes

- Winter Home
- Secret Base
- Fantasy Abode
- Survival Base
- Haunted House

## Sledding event

- Saturaday the 6th looking good for sledding event potentially
- A good selection of execs want to go
- Be aware of COVID cases increase, might not be the best idea to run a physical event

## Hackfrost

- Going well so far, more outreach is yet to be done, likely create some discussion about it in `#general` in MUNCS
- Not much to note in this meeting since Hackfrost is being handled externally to this society

## Networking Event

- Do another one of these, last time was good, but this time the format will be as follows:

> - No breakout rooms, one big room for everyone
> - Each speaker has 15 - 20 mins of time to talk about thems
> - After the speakers are finished, let them have a 'fireside chat' between themselves afterwards
> - Then a Q&A session for people to ask questions to the speakers
