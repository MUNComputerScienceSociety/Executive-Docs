# Agenda Topics

## Role Shuffling

- Want to open up positions, especially seeing as most of the executives are leaving MUN soon
    - Likely going to open up the specific roles for people to apply for, if a rep doesn't get a role, they can stay on as a general representative
- The sports representative role has been removed for the time being
- an international student representative role has been added
- Marty is stepping down as President, with Jack taking over for now
- We can have multiple people per role, seeing as Andrew wishes to take on less this semester
- This will be discussed in greater detail once we have people applying for roles

## Advertising the Society

- We're looking to advertise the society through the computer science mailing list, especially seeing as classes won't be in person
