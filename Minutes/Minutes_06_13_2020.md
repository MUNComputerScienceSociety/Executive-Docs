# Agenda Topics

## Organized Resources/Website Rebuild
- The plan is to rebuild our website
- Probably Gatsby instead of what's being used currently
- GraphQL wrapper around the minutes/other things?
- Resources:
  - Much more fleshed out than Discord can offer
  - Try and organize such that students can post resources themselves
    - Would be nice if it had a git-style interface
    - Need to ensure copyrighted content doesn't stay up though
  - Would likely start with an internal use stage within the executives to populate with some starting resources
- Key objectives for a rebuild:
  - Maintain the archive
  - Make the interface prettier/more easily accessible
- Jack will start on a Gatsby project, details to follow in next Saturdays meeting

## Other Resources
- Would live in the resources page
- Things like video tutorials could be posted here and integrated into the website
