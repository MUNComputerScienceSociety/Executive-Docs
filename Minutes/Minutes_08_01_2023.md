## CS UGC (Computer Science Undergraduate Comity) Rep
- Mat potentially able to do from now until December, needs confirming
- Will need someone for Jan onwards

## Constitution changes
- We have quorum (2/3) agreeing we should have a meeting to discuss this, therefore moving forward.
- The meeting to discuss does not need everyone to attend, we will post up a PR after to our website and get everyone to :thumbs-up: the PR as entire executive approval on the revised constitution

## Event Coordinator
- We currently lack this explicit role, others will have to step up to help organize events

## Financial Update
- Gizem replacing Ripu as Treasurer
- Planning to move away from BMO to RBC, cumbersome with the current account setup we have with BMO
- Gizem talked to RBC on campus, we should be able to setup an account better suited for student societies with them.
- Gizem taking care of this task
- We 'have a decent amount of money' - Ethan
- We are looking for ways to make more money in the future, and hopefully not run events that lose us money

## Welcome / Orientation / Outreach

### Outreach
- Leah can coordinate, might not be the person to be there in person to talk
- Do up a poster like similar ones for profs to put in D2L
- Consider doing in-person, pick people that are free during the first couple of 1001/2/3 etc. slots

### Science Orientation
- Student or two to setup a booth
- Find students to fill those roles

### MUNSU Clubs and Societies Fair
- Where: 3rd floor of the UC
- When: Monday, September 18th, from 11am -> 2pm
- Nobody on this yet, but good to consider attending, speak to MUNSU (Russel?)

### Rotman School of Mgmt.
- Reached out to society about advertising info session about their school
- If they have content they want us to post here in Discord, we shall do so, likely not much else in the way of involvement

## Events

### Chess Night
- Being organized by Ethan and Emily

### Movie Night
- Will be organized by Leah
- Considering watching a CS-centric movie
  - Matrix / Ex-Machina thrown out as potential watches
- `meet@mun.ca` for booking rooms, https://www.mun.ca/meet/about/book-space/
- Might run into problems if we intend on having / allowing food

### Programming Competition
- Partner with MUN C^2
- Code golf theme rather than the usual Kattis type competition
- `maz` on the case, showed interest in meeting chat, and is now on executive as Rep-At-Large

### Our own welcome event
- Might just be the science orientation, don't _have_ to have our own event
- Would be nice to have our own event for this though still, second or third week of semester
- Could be an info session that then becomes a mixer
  - If we pick a Wednesday that is also open mic night the breezeway should be open late which is a pro
- Ameli√© might be able to take care of this, not in the meeting currently to confirm
- Maybe get faculty in the info session, such as Hatcher

### Mixer(s)
- Mixers last years were good
- We didn't rent out the Breezeway last year, but we did pay for pizza and such
- We should have more mixers, but not have them be a financial strain on the society
- We should have mixers in the clubroom again
  - They are profitable
  - However, more paperwork, and we haven't done a mixer like this post covid
  - Russel from MUNSU might be able to help us sort this out

### Summer social with Grad Society
- Came to nothing :(, Ethan got no response from whoever asked us about this

### Hacktoberfest
- Happening in October
- We might have a in-person event for this
- At least we will advertise this as an society event online during this time, and maybe encourage contributions to society repos
