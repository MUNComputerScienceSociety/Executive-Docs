## Items from Last Week

    - Update from last week's Among Us Night: We didn't get much of a turnout. We will improve advertising and try it again.
    
- Trivia Night
    - Zach and Lo Yee are looking into the best way to run a remote trivia night. Once the tech is figured out we will decide on a time to host

## This Week
- Zach will be away for the next couple weeks, so event questions should go to Madison.


## Computer Science Undergrad Studies Committee meeting
- Mathew went to a faculty Computer Science Undergrad Studies Committee meeting. Some CS profs who are in charge of updating calender, proposing new streams to the program. Overview: 

- Creation of a Data Science Stream
    - Current courses are not very data science related
    - Need to find full-time faculty to oversee creation of related and required courses

- Clarifying STAT2550 and STAT2500 as a pre-requisite in Calender
    - STAT2500 will still be accepted for the CS Major
    - Certain 3000 and 4000 level CS courses will be updated to show STAT2550 as the pre-requisite
        - STAT2500 will be removed as a pre-requisite for these courses
            - These courses will be announced in next meeting
    - This is being presented to the Senate this week

- Suggested Amendments to the Admission Requirements for CS Major
    - Current grade requirement is an overall of 61%
    - Suggestion: Increase to a 65% minimum in COMP1001 and COMP1002
        - Debate whether it should be min of 65% in either COMP1001 or COMP1002
        - Other option is 65% mean for both courses
    - Data suggests students who receive lower than a 65% in COMP1001 or COMP1002:
        - Take COMP2001, COMP2002, or COMP2003 1.7 times
        - Students who receive higher than 65% take them 1.0 times 
    - Still under discussion, will not be brought to Senate this year

## Social Media
- Elliot is going to be making social media posts to promote AMong Us night to help improve participation. 
- We need to get all of our social media credentials to Elliot so that he can be making posts everywhere.
- Look into using postermywall to create promotional posters for events.


## Upcoming Events
- We are going to try to organize a second earlier time for Among Us so that it is more accessible for international students. (We don't use FB much, trying to move people over to discord)

## Among Us Night
- With the previously noted adjustments, we will be running Among Us night again.
- We are also going to look at adding an earlier time so that international students can participate. 

## Outside get together
