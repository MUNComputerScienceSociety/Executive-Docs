# Agenda Topics

## COVID-19
- Due to the cancellations and closures due to COVID-19, we're cancelling the following until further notice:
    - Future Mixers (April 3rd)
    - Discord Bot Workshop
    - Board Game Night (March 17th)
- Some members will also be absent in person the coming weeks, but the Society will likely be online-only for the coming weeks

## Clothing Order
- Likely to be delayed, we'll wait to organize this

## Challenge Set
- Community engagement has been pretty low, so we'll probably end this for the year, picking up next year
- Jack will be leaving the reigns available if other society members want to pick up this


# Other Topics

## Socially Distanced Events
- We could organize some gaming events. Games include:
    - Minecraft
    - Team Fortress 2
    - Xonotic
    - CS:GO
    - Jackbox
    - Project Cars
    - EU4/Civilization
