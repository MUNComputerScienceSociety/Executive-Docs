# Meeting Minutes

## Game Dev Workshop Update

* Hamood has been trying his hardest to get a room for a Game Dev Workshop event. No luck, MUN is making it harder than what it should.

## PicoCAD

* It wasn't the best, but it was ok. Not a lot of interest
* Most submissions were from Exec
* Save the prize for another event

## Kattis Comp

* Another one soon?
* This Friday?

## Future events?

* Not Gmod, didn't go over well.
* Poll future events? Any feedback on how we promote events? What would members like to see?
* Is online the event killer?
* Jackbox maybe?
* Seminar room for games and board games (What is the capacity)
* In person event for end of the semester. Good way to socialize. Talk to other people from Alexander Murray Club (They are in the society reps discord) 18th?

## Colton's Microphone Update

* Will be working next week, hopefully.
