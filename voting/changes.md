## Proposals for Constitutional Amendments for the MUN Computer Science Society

**BIG THINGS**

1.  Replace the role of Social Representative with two new roles: Outreach Coordinator and Marketing Officer.
    

1.  The Outreach Coordinator will be responsible for interacting with students both physically and digitally, including posters, social media, etc.
    
2.  The Marketing Officer shall be responsible for producing any marketing materials, including posters, slides, etc.
    

3.  Replace Representative-At-Large and First Year Representative with a new, non-voting role: Society Volunteer
    

1.  Society Volunteer will largely serve the same purpose and have the same responsibilities as Representative-At-Large.
    
2.  It will be a non-voting role, which may be applied for by any member of the society and granted at the discretion of the exec.
    

5.  Remove the role of Hack Frost Rep (Madison, head of Hack Frost, has suggested that it is no longer necessary).
    
6.  Add the role of Executive Alumni, a non-voting role for former members of the exec who wish to remain in an advisory capacity. We already have this unofficially (Honourary Executive).
    
7.  Restrict nominations in elections to those who are a current or former member of the exec (including both voting and non-voting roles). This ensures that those applying for roles have (ideally) done some amount of work for the society before they can put themselves forward for a voting role.
    
8.  Allow any member of the society to be appointed to an empty role, with preference given to Society Volunteers
    
9.  Move election procedures to a by-law
    
10.  Move meeting procedures to a by-law
    

**SMALL THINGS**

1.  Add a definition of a “Voting Role”: any role except Society Volunteer and Executive Alumni would be allowed to vote in meetings.
    
2.  Remove the role of “Representative Advisor”.
    
3.  Add a rule that if there is only one nominee (incumbent or incoming) for a position, then that nominee shall be acclaimed for that position.
    
4.  Make an addition to the duties of the Science Society Representative, indicating that they should communicate any items which should be on the agenda at an exec meeting before the meeting so that they can be discussed.
    
5.  Make an addition to the duties of the Tech Officer, indicating that they are responsible for managing the Discord server, Discord bots, and storing passwords and records relating to their duties.
    
6.  Change the notice period for an exec meeting to 72 hours (rather than 24), or 24 in case of emergency (previously unspecified)
    
7.  Change the rules for calling meetings to: “The Executive shall strive for bi-weekly Executive meetings during the academic year, excluding the months of April, May, June, July, August, and December. Meetings during the excluded months shall be called as necessary”
    
8.  Add a restriction for signing authorities that they may not have a “conflict of interest”
